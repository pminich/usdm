# **Converting USDM YAML to OpenAPI Specification**
This script is designed to parse a USDM-compliant YAML file, convert it into a valid OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and save the resulting OpenAPI YAML to a file. Below are the instructions for its usage.
## **Requirements**
Ensure that you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js and npm**:
    - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Dependencies**:
    - Install the necessary npm packages using the following command in the project directory:
``` bash
     npm install js-yaml ts-node
```
## **Steps to Use**
### 1. Prepare Input File
- Place the USDM YAML file you want to convert in the `dataStructure.yml` file at the appropriate directory (as mentioned in the `filePath` in the script).
- Example `dataStructure.yml` structure:
``` yaml
   Address:
     NCI C-Code: C42610
     Definition: "A description of the address."
     Preferred Term: "Address"
     Attributes:
       Street:
         Type: ["#/string"]
         "Cardinality": "1..1"
       City:
         Type: ["#/string"]
         "Cardinality": "1..1"
```
### 2. Run the Script
- Execute the script using the following command:
``` bash
  ts-node yaml2OpenApiGenerator.ts
```
- If successful, the generated OpenAPI file will be saved in the same directory as `USDM-Model_openapi.yaml`.

### 3. Output
#### Output File
The script generates an `OpenAPI` YAML file. This file contains:
- **OpenAPI Metadata** (e.g., title, version).
- **Schemas**: Mapped from the USDM YAML.

Example Generated File (`USDM-Model_openapi.yaml`):
``` yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: USDM to OpenAPI
  version: 1.0.0
paths: {}
components:
  schemas:
    Address:
      type: object
      description: |
        NCI C-Code: C42610
        Definition: A description of the address.
        Preferred Term: Address
      properties:
        Street:
          type: string
        City:
          type: string
      required:
        - Street
        - City
```
## **Error Handling**
The script will log warnings and continue processing even if:
1. Invalid or missing fields are found in the YAML.
2. An unsupported `Type` or malformed attribute is detected.

If the script fails entirely, an error message will be printed on the console:
``` bash
Error loading or parsing YAML: [error details]
```
## **Customization**
You can adapt the script for your specific needs:
1. Modify `mapProperty` to handle more data types or relationships.
2. Change the `info` section in `generateOpenApiFromUsdm()` for custom metadata (e.g., title, version).

## **Debugging**
If youâ€™d like to inspect the intermediate objects (such as `USDM` or individual schemas), you can insert `console.log` lines or use `util.inspect`:
``` typescript
import { inspect } from 'util';
console.log(inspect(openApiDoc, { depth: null, colors: true }));
```
## **FAQs**
### **What is the purpose of the script?**
It converts USDM-compliant YAML into an OpenAPI specification for use in API documentation, testing, and development.
### **Can I add additional attributes to the OpenAPI schema?**
Yes, you can customize the `convertUsdmClassToSchema` function to include additional fields or metadata by modifying how attributes are processed and mapped.
### **What happens if the input YAML is invalid?**
The script logs warnings or errors, depending on the severity, and tries to process as much of the data as possible. Ensure your YAML is properly formatted.
